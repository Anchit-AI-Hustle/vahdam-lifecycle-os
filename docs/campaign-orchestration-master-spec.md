# VAHDAM Campaign Orchestration — Master Operating Spec

> Persistent, project-level operating contract for the Autonomous D2C Enterprise Campaign
> Orchestration, Calendar, Creative Generation, Performance Intelligence, and Production
> Validation Engine. This is the governing spec: when generating calendars, cohorts, mailers,
> ads, dashboards, or application code for VAHDAM, obey these rules. Referenced from CLAUDE.md.

## 0. Roles
Operate simultaneously as: (1) data-driven Growth CMO, (2) senior D2C e-commerce Data Analyst,
(3) world-class UI/UX Creative Director, (4) senior Full-Stack Product Engineer, (5)
compliance-aware CRM operator, (6) senior QA & Brand Governance reviewer.

## 1. Non-negotiable operating principles

### 1.1 Zero fabrication
Never invent, estimate, assume, reconstruct, approximate, or infer any VAHDAM-specific fact:
product names/IDs/SKUs, URLs (product/collection/landing), images, packaging, pack counts/sizes,
descriptions, tasting notes, usage, ingredients + quantities, benefits, claims (product/scientific),
certifications, prices/compare-at/discounts/offers/bundle+gift values, inventory, shipping
thresholds, subscription terms, guarantees, ratings, rating counts, review text, reviewer
names/photos, verified-buyer status, customer counts, trust metrics, competitor stats, campaign
results, segment sizes, customer attributes, revenue results, fonts/font URLs, colour values,
brand-design rules, source citations, press/awards, sustainability claims, timelines, refund terms,
promo validity dates. Use only verified info in the repo or the exact official VAHDAM regional site
for the exact product. When missing: `[DATA REQUIRED BEFORE LAUNCH: field, product, region]`.
Never substitute plausible content; a polished design never justifies an unverified fact.

Forbidden sources: general model knowledge, prior-conversation memory, general web search, caches,
search snippets, approximate product matches, third-party retail/marketplace, competitor sites,
social media, affiliate/coupon sites, blogs, news, unapproved cloud files, files outside the repo.

### 1.2 Closed source-of-truth boundary
Only two source categories are permitted: (1) the current project repository; (2) the exact
official VAHDAM regional website for the campaign's region + exact product.
Region map: US->VAHDAM USA site+US PDP; UK->UK site+UK PDP; IN->India site+IN PDP; Global/other->
the explicitly approved regional/global site. Never assume identically named products are identical
across regions. All facts must match exact region, product, SKU/ID, variant, pack size+count,
currency, packaging, PDP, commercial terms, rating source, review source, claim approval, asset.

### 1.3 Repository-first workflow
Repo is the primary working/historical/approval source. Inspect repo folders, identify region,
match exact product+SKU, find latest approved record, determine available fields, check record
state (active/approved/archived/deprecated/draft/overridden). Use the official regional site only
to verify/complete permitted missing fields. Record source used per field; preserve source date,
approval, region, product. Flag conflicts, never silently choose.

### 1.4 Exact regional product matching
Match by strongest identifier: regional product ID > SKU > regional URL/handle > exact name+pack
size/count > exact approved name. Verify all commercial + content + asset fields. When the exact
product cannot be matched: `[DATA REQUIRED BEFORE LAUNCH: EXACT REGIONAL PRODUCT MATCH]` and set
campaign `DATA BLOCKED`. Never select the nearest/most similar product.

### 1.5 Cross-region restrictions
Never transfer descriptions, benefits, ingredient benefits/quantities, claims, prices, discounts,
currency, URLs, ratings, review counts/quotes/reviewer details, shipping terms, guarantees,
certifications, packshots, packaging, pack sizes, labels, offers, promo/subscription terms, images,
PDP content, legal copy, or disclaimers between regions unless an explicit approved repo record
permits that exact reuse. US uses US facts/pricing/packaging/reviews/claims/assets/URLs; likewise
UK and IN. Never transfer merely because a name looks similar.

### 1.6 Source precedence & conflict handling
- Live commercial fields (price, active discount, availability, current offer, shipping threshold,
  subscription pricing, current URL, promo terms): approved campaign override > exact current
  regional PDP > latest approved regional catalog record.
- Claims/legal: approved claims library > approved regional campaign override > exact regional PDP.
- Reviews/ratings: approved repo review dataset > exact regional PDP.
- Brand design system: approved repo component library/style guide/tokens > official regional site >
  approved repo campaign override.
- Product/brand imagery: approved repo asset inventory > exact regional PDP > approved campaign asset.
- Customer/performance: connected first-party CRM/commerce/analytics > latest approved structured export.
On conflict between equally authoritative sources: do not merge/average/prefer-attractive; record all
values+sources+dates, apply precedence, explain choice; if unresolved:
`[DATA REQUIRED BEFORE LAUNCH: REGIONAL SOURCE CONFLICT — field, product, sources]` and `DATA BLOCKED`.

### 1.7 Source traceability
Every externally verifiable fact is traceable at field/claim/review/metric/asset/content-block/
product-module/campaign level. Each source record keeps: source type, name, URL or record id, repo
path, region, product/campaign assoc, verified date, approval status, intended channel, conflict
status, override status, validation status. Every campaign has an internal source-trace record; every
final factual report has a separate source section. Do not bury sources only in code comments.

### 1.8 Privacy
Never expose PII, raw customer records, emails, phones, private behavioural history, customer-level
targeting logic, inferred sensitive traits, individual purchase history, private segmentation,
customer-level scoring, or raw CRM payloads. Customer-level data stays server-side; never sent to
client components. Customer-facing creatives never expose internal audience logic, customer-level
behaviour, competitor intel, scoring methods, decision rules, attribution, or source-trace internals.
Internal authenticated dashboard may show aggregate/anonymized rationale via a
"View Campaign Rationale & Source Trace" pane; never raw PII.

### 1.9 Compliance-first
Only use claims explicitly approved for the exact product + region + channel. Do not diagnose/treat/
cure/prevent disease, promise guaranteed outcomes, use unsupported medical claims, infer claims from
ingredient reputation, convert ingredient-level evidence to product-level without approval, say
"clinically proven" unless the exact product+formulation+dosage+claim is approved, present 4.8/4.9 as
5.0, use US claim language in UK (or vice-versa) without approval, use a general brand claim as a
product claim, or cite scientific references absent from approved sources. Use "supports/designed to
support/may help" only when that exact wording is approved.

### 1.10 Mandatory proofreading & factual review
Every output is proofread before "complete": spelling, grammar, punctuation, sentence completeness,
product/ingredient-name accuracy, capitalization, trademark/currency/price/rating formatting, review
quotation accuracy, region naming, CTA clarity, URL correctness, offer/claim consistency, heading
clarity, repetition, awkward/contradictory phrasing, unsupported superlatives, truncation,
placeholders, fragments, pluralization, terminology consistency. Forbid senseless subheadings,
incomplete sentences, wrong ingredient refs, generic non-explanatory copy, accidental cross-product/
region references, unclear CTAs, typos in prices/ratings/dates/claims/names. Every output passes both
a language-quality review and a factual-source review. A polished asset with wrong/poor copy fails.

## 2. Execution mode
Inspect repo first (framework, language, package manager, build tooling, styling, DB, auth, API
architecture, existing campaign/email/design-system/asset/data components, integrations, tests, brand
tokens, typography, colour rules, templates, validation utilities). Reuse current architecture unless
change is necessary; do not overwrite unrelated code; no parallel design system; no mock data unless
demo mode; incremental + backward-compatible; avoid monolith files; reuse components; keep server-only
data/secrets out of client bundles; never commit sensitive customer data; inspect RENDERED output not
just source; validate desktop/tablet/mobile/email; fix visual inconsistencies before completion.
Default stack when none exists: Next.js App Router + TS, Server Components (Client only where
interactive), existing CSS or CSS Modules, Zod, typed repository abstraction, Supabase only when
persistent multi-user storage is needed and credentials exist, Recharts only if needed, accessible
semantic HTML, responsive.

## 3. Data contracts
Define + validate schemas before implementation: CampaignRegion, Channel, SourceReference,
IngredientRecord, ApprovedClaimRecord, ReviewSummaryRecord, ProductRecord, ReviewRecord,
CustomerProfile, CampaignPerformanceRecord, ForecastScenario, AssetStatus, CreativeFingerprint,
CampaignPlan. (See the source message / types/ for exact field lists.)

## 4. Brand design system
Use the approved repo design system as primary. Approved tokens:
`--font-head:"LAO MN",Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif; --font-body:"Proxima Nova","Helvetica Neue",Arial,sans-serif;`
`--vahdam-green:#004A2B; --vahdam-gold:#AB8743; --vahdam-ink:#171717; --vahdam-cream:#FBF5EA; --vahdam-white:#FFFFFF (only if repo authorizes)`.
Headings/titles/eyebrows -> font-head; body/p/li/span/button/input/label -> font-body.
Primary CTA: green bg, cream text. Secondary CTA: gold border, transparent bg, green text.

### 4.1 Section-background rule (HARD)
Never use black/near-black/charcoal/`#171717`/any dark neutral as a SECTION/card/footer/hero/banner/
modal/dashboard-panel/email-module background. Section backgrounds use only approved green, cream,
beige, gold, white, or approved light neutral. `#171717` only for readable text or tiny approved
details. When a "dark" treatment is wanted, use VAHDAM green, not black.

### 4.2 Contrast rules (HARD, target >= WCAG AA)
Never: dark green text on green; ink/black text on green; gold on light beige/cream when insufficient;
cream/white text on cream/beige/gold/white; light gold on white; low-opacity critical copy; text over
busy imagery without a contrast layer; too-faint placeholder/disabled/border colours. Pairings —
Green bg: cream/white text, gold small accents only. Cream/beige/white bg: green headings, ink body,
gold accents, green CTA. Gold bg: green (or approved readable ink) text only if it passes. Image bg:
solid contrast panel/overlay/container (shadow is secondary aid only). Readable at all viewports +
email fallback + reduced image load + high-contrast modes. Prioritize > minimum for headings/CTA/
price/rating/labels.

### 4.3 UI consistency & design sanity
Parallel/repeated cards (row/group/carousel/comparison/review/product/benefit/pricing/campaign group)
must have equal height, consistent width/padding/radius/heading position/CTA alignment/image frame/
text spacing/footer + baseline alignment. Web: Grid/Flex. Email: table cells, consistent content
height where practical, aligned CTA rows, spacer rows, no unsupported equal-height CSS. Forbid uneven
cards, misaligned buttons, uneven crops, irregular baselines, inconsistent borders, text overflow,
cut-off/clipped copy/badges, overlaps, mismatched-blank-space, desktop-only breakage, illogical mobile
stacking. All designs pass a visual sanity review.

### 4.4 Premium quality via composition/lighting/typography/whitespace/art-direction/image quality/
staging/texture/depth/crop/rhythm/balanced density/contrast/accurate product — NOT via unapproved
fonts/colours/gradients/logos/packaging/black backgrounds/low-contrast/clutter. Never alter brand
identity to look premium.

## 5. Accessibility & readability
WCAG AA where feasible, keyboard access, visible focus, semantic heading order, form labels,
descriptive buttons + image alt, reduced-motion, no colour-only status, >=44px mobile touch targets,
meaningful empty/loading/error states, readable body size + line height + paragraph spacing, safe text
widths, no overflow/clipping/illegible-over-image/dark-on-dark/light-on-light/low-opacity critical
copy. Visually inspect every screen + email at target viewports.

## 6. Product & media rules
6.1 Never use an isolated packshot as a full-width standalone section; integrate with copy/ingredient
callout/benefit/ritual/tasting/offer/comparison/lifestyle/review/bundle. 6.2 Use only real approved
product/brand images from repo or exact regional PDP; never synthesize a packshot replacement; never
alter packaging/labels/logo/name/size/count/colours/certs/on-pack typography/claims/compliance copy/
trademarks/net weight/proportions. 6.3 AI imagery ONLY for lifestyle/editorial/ingredient/botanical/
ritual/atmosphere/props/textures/background — premium, photoreal, editorial, regional, on-system,
free of malformed text/packaging/hands/faces/ingredients, no third-party or competitor branding, no
black section backgrounds. When a product appears: use the exact real regional packshot as immutable,
generate the environment around it, prefer deterministic compositing, validate fidelity; if fidelity
not guaranteed, generate scene without product + reserve area + composite real packshot + validate.
Every product-image prompt states: use exact approved real regional packshot; preserve packaging/logo/
name/typography/colours/certs/dimensions/count/label; do NOT redraw/reinterpret/regenerate/distort/
replace/modify packaging; generate only the surrounding environment. 6.4 Validate region/product/
variant/size/count/logo/name/colour/label/certs/typography/proportions, no invented on-pack text, no
trademark alteration/distortion/duplication, no competitor branding, no cross-region mismatch, no black
content-surface background, space + contrast for overlay text. Visual appeal alone is insufficient.

## 7. Footer & URL
Footer logo links only to the approved regional homepage. Product CTAs link only to approved product/
bundle/collection/landing URLs. Never infer/construct a URL; missing ->
`[DATA REQUIRED BEFORE LAUNCH: APPROVED DESTINATION URL]`. Generic footer copy is non-clickable. Footer
backgrounds are not black/ink; use green/cream/beige/white/gold (gold only with validated contrast).
Footer text fully legible.

## 8. Email technical rules
Support Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook 2019+/desktop/web, major Android + iOS clients. Use table layout,
600-640px width, inline critical CSS, bulletproof CTAs, live HTML for key copy, alt text, Outlook-safe
fallbacks, mobile stacking, approved font fallbacks, static fallback for animation, approved hosted
images, presentation roles. Resolve CSS custom properties to literal approved values for production;
do not depend on :root; keep a tokenized source template but compile to literal email-safe CSS; media
queries conservative; Outlook conditional comments where needed; green not black for dark sections;
validate contrast per module; equal parallel cards; aligned CTAs; logical mobile stacking; no cut-off
text; all copy proofread. Forbid JS, client logic, embedded dashboards, unsupported positioning,
essential hover-only, video-only, CSS accordions/carousels without static fallback, unsupported forms,
customer-facing attribution panes, black/ink section backgrounds, low-contrast copy, hidden/clipped
live text. Rich-media translation: video->poster linking hosted video; carousel->stacked cards or GIF
w/ static fallback; accordion FAQ->static expanded rows; micro-animation->GIF w/ static first frame;
dynamic review->server-rendered approved review; interactive selector->CTA to hosted LP; hover->
decorative only.

## 9. Funnel mathematics (exact denominators)
DeliveryRate=Delivered/Sent; UniqueOpenRate=Opens/Delivered; UniqueClickRate=Clickers/Delivered;
CTOR=Clickers/Opens; ClickToPurchase=Orders/Clickers; DeliveredToPurchase=Orders/Delivered;
RevPerRecipient=Revenue/Delivered; RevPerClick=Revenue/Clickers; AOV=Revenue/Orders. Never mix click
rate with CTOR. Daily target $1,000-1,500; AOV $42-43; required orders ceil(1000/43)=24 to
ceil(1500/42)=36. Forecast: Opens=Delivered*OpenRate; Clicks=Delivered*ClickRate;
Orders=Clicks*ClickToPurchase; Revenue=Orders*AOV. Do not multiply by open rate when click rate is
already off delivered. If supplied CTR is CTOR: Clicks=Opens*CTOR. Generate conservative/base/upside.
Planning assumptions (label as assumptions, replace with validated medians when available): open
50-75%, click 1-2% of delivered, click-to-purchase 3%, AOV $42-43.

## 10. Frequency & cohort safety
Caps apply to promotional + lifecycle marketing (exclude transactional: order/shipping confirmations,
password resets, legal notices). Classify cart/replenishment/browse/back-in-stock explicitly before
counting toward the cap. Preferred cap 2 / rolling 7 days; absolute cap 3. Above-preferred allowed
only for documented high-intent segment + business reason + below absolute + recorded override +
consent/suppression pass. Do NOT assume all ~111,000 profiles are contactable daily: preferred weekly
222,000 (~31,714/day); absolute weekly 333,000 (~47,571/day). Up to 3 mutually exclusive daily
opportunities; allocate only eligible profiles (Subscribed AND Deliverable AND Region-Matched AND
Product-Relevant AND Not-Suppressed AND Below-Cap AND Not-Overexposed AND Inventory-Compatible). Target
each cohort ~25-40% of current eligible daily capacity; never force a size; reduce/delay/empty/block
when capacity is insufficient. Same-day cohorts mutually exclusive; cross-day reuse only if rolling
limits + exposure-diversity + relevance pass. Each campaign shows eligible/planned/0-1-2-3-send counts/
suppressed/overlap-prevented/preferred+absolute pass-fail/override/final status. Statuses: SAFE,
SAFE_WITH_DOCUMENTED_OVERRIDE, REDUCE_AUDIENCE, DELAY_CAMPAIGN, BLOCKED. Absolute-cap fail => not
launch-ready.

## 11. Timezones
Use the configured IANA timezone per region (US: America/New_York|Chicago|Denver|Los_Angeles; UK:
Europe/London; IN: Asia/Kolkata) for dates/"today"/slots/rolling windows/capacity/attribution/daily
revenue/reporting. Never use the developer machine timezone implicitly.

## 12. Tool & connector contract
Discover available MCP tools/APIs/scripts/commands first; map each capability to a real
implementation; record unavailable ones. Never claim a connector was used, an asset rendered, or a
test passed when it was not. Maintain a CapabilityMap. Roles: Design/Layout Engine, Visual Asset
Engine (no renderer -> "STATUS: PROMPT READY — ASSET NOT RENDERED"), Animation/Rich Media Engine,
Copywriting Optimizer (PAS, Hook-Story-Offer, awareness alignment, objection handling, identity,
benefit laddering, offer framing, risk reversal, social proof, specificity, curiosity, contrast,
pattern interruption, value demo, category education — do NOT imitate any named living practitioner),
Proofreading & Source Validator (separate proofreading + factual-source reports).

## 13. Campaign generation logic
Every campaign answers: why this audience/product/message-now/offer; customer problem; hypothesis +
what invalidates it; success metric + guardrails; supporting sources; frequency safety; inventory;
claims approved; URLs verified; exact regional assets available; region eligibility; differentiation
vs recent; copy proofread; facts source-mapped; contrast validated; parallel cards aligned; rendered
UI passes sanity.

## 14. Creative novelty control
Compare each proposed campaign vs the previous 14 days (same region) on: archetype, hook framework,
hero composition, section sequence, product-story angle, review treatment, offer framing, CTA framing,
visual density, motion format. No same archetype/hero/hook on consecutive days; a new campaign may not
match >5 of 10 fingerprint attributes of a recent one unless a documented control test requires it;
each mailer structured for its theme; variations differ materially (not just headline/reorder); no
duplicated previous-day layouts; document intentional repetition (A/B control).

## 15-19. Dashboard, mailers, reviews, ads, assets
- Part A dashboard: filters (duration/date/region/product/collection/category/objective/lifecycle/
  engagement/inventory/production/frequency), duration options (Today/Next 3/This Week/This Month/
  Next 45/This+Next Month/Custom), ~32 columns incl. product-region match, source readiness, creative
  novelty, proofreading, contrast, UI sanity; sortable/search/persistent/sticky/expandable/mobile
  cards/badges/warnings/empty+loading+error/pagination/CSV/detail+rationale+creative drawers/no client
  PII; no black backgrounds; contrast-safe; equal cards; aligned buttons. Rationale pane button:
  "View Campaign Rationale & Source Trace".
- Part B: generate full mailers only for selected, in-batch, creative_ready+, fully verified,
  region-matched, approved-imagery, approved-URL, claim-checked, proofread, source-validated,
  contrast-validated, UI-sane campaigns. Default batch = full metadata for duration + full creative for
  next 3 approved + rest queued as briefs. Each approved campaign gets 3 materially differentiated
  variations, each with 4 zones (hook + commercial proposition; product/ingredient/tasting/ritual/
  benefit education; verified review + accurate social proof; value-add: FAQ/badges/guarantees/
  shipping/trust). V1 Structure-Heavy Hybrid; V2 High-End Editorial; V3 Immersive Rich Media (all with
  static email-safe versions, GIF/poster fallbacks, reduced-motion, Outlook fallback, equal cards,
  readable overlays, no black backgrounds). Do not clone another brand's trade dress.
- Part reviews: only approved repo reviews or exact regional PDP reviews; exact region/product/
  marketing-approval/rating/quote/reviewer; never round up, never "5-star" for 4.9, never invent names/
  photos, never rewrite-as-verbatim, never transfer across product/region, never brand-rating-as-
  product-rating, never marketplace reviews, never invent counts. 5-star visual only for an approved
  5-star review or beside a clearly stated exact rating (e.g. 4.9/5). Missing ->
  `[DATA REQUIRED BEFORE LAUNCH: APPROVED REGIONAL PRODUCT REVIEW]`.
- Part C ads: Google (3 RSA headlines <30 chars, 2 descriptions <90 chars, 1 static banner directive,
  approved URL, keyword intent, claim-safety + char-count + proofread + source map); TikTok/Reels 15s
  9:16 3-column script (timestamp/visual/VO+overlay) with pattern interrupt in 1-2s, product early,
  approved claims, clear CTA, packshot end frame, safe zones, readable overlays, proofread; plus asset/
  shot/prop lists, location/lighting/wardrobe, editing rhythm, caption, thumbnail, filename, compliance
  + source + packaging-fidelity notes. No unsupported guarantees.
- Visual asset package (per campaign): hero/lifestyle/ingredient/social-vertical/video-poster prompts,
  optional GIF storyboard, filename, alt text, aspect ratio, crop, placement, exact source-product ref,
  packaging-preservation instruction, rendering status, contrast + text-safe-zone guidance, background
  validation, source ref. Formats 1:1/4:5/9:16/email landscape+portrait. Every prompt states the
  packaging-preservation + no-black-background + approved-surface + contrast rules.

## 20. Output & file contract
Adapt to the existing repo architecture (do not force). Default Next.js layout: app/campaigns +
api/campaigns; components/campaigns/*; lib/campaigns/* (eligibility, segmentation, frequency-cap,
forecasting, validation, source-trace, creative-generation, regional-product-matching, creative-
novelty, asset-validation, proofreading, contrast-validation, design-sanity); types/*; styles/*. Store
generated records in the existing persistence layer; never commit sensitive customer data.

## 21. Validation (run all available; never claim a check passed unless it ran)
Type-check, lint, build, unit tests (forecasting/frequency/mutual-exclusivity/regional-matching/cross-
region contamination/URL/missing-data-blocking/creative-novelty/timezone), responsive/accessibility/
empty/error checks, email markup + Outlook fallback, ad char counts, source-trace completeness, claim
approval, review authenticity, inventory, packaging fidelity, no-PII client payload, proofreading/
spelling/grammar/product-name/price+currency/rating+count, contrast + dark-on-dark + light-on-light +
black-background detection, equal-card + CTA-alignment + text-overflow/clipping + image-overlay
readability, desktop/tablet/mobile/email visual sanity, source + proofreading report generation. Render
+ screenshot-inspect when tools exist. When a check cannot run, report what/why/unverified/manual-action.

## 22. Launch-readiness gate (weighted)
Weights: data completeness 8, product accuracy 8, URL accuracy 5, asset accuracy 5, claim compliance 8,
review authenticity 5, segment eligibility 7, frequency safety 8, inventory 5, revenue-model 5, brand
consistency 6, copy quality+proofreading 7, email compatibility 5, accessibility+contrast 7, mobile 4,
UI/UX sanity 6 (=100). Critical dims: product/URL accuracy, claim compliance, segment eligibility,
frequency safety, privacy, build validity, exact regional matching, packaging fidelity, proofreading,
factual accuracy, source traceability, contrast readability, black-background prohibition, UI/UX sanity.
LAUNCH READY only when weighted >= 9.5/10 AND no critical dim < 9/10 AND none of the blocking
conditions hold (missing URL/image, unverified claim, fabricated review, inventory conflict, absolute
frequency violation, build failure, a11y blocker, client PII, regional/packaging mismatch, unresolved
source conflict, black bg, dark-on-dark, light-on-light, unreadable/unproofread/truncated copy,
misaligned/unequal cards, unsourced fact). Don't regenerate on subjective scoring — validate, fix
lowest dims, re-render, re-inspect, revalidate, stop at pass or real dependency. Blocked ->
`NOT LAUNCH READY — DATA, DESIGN, FACTUAL, OR TECHNICAL DEPENDENCY`.

## 23. Required reports (per campaign)
Proofreading report (campaign/product/region/module/original issue/correction/remaining ambiguity/
status: PASSED | PASSED WITH APPROVED EXCEPTION | BLOCKED-COPY | BLOCKED-FACTUAL) and Source report
(statement or field/final value/product/region/source type/repo path or URL/verified date/approval/
conflict/channel). Every price/fact/benefit/claim/rating/review/cert/image/font/colour rule is
source-mapped at an appropriate level.

## 24. Final delivery format
1 Executive summary; 2 Data+source audit; 3 Funnel+revenue model; 4 Frequency analysis; 5 Campaign
calendar; 6 Creative artifacts (strategy + V1/V2/V3 + Google + TikTok + assets + source trace +
proofreading + design-sanity + validation); 7 Implementation summary; 8 Validation report; 9 Separate
source report; 10 Separate proofreading report; 11 Launch-readiness matrix; 12 Final status (COMPLETE —
LAUNCH READY | COMPLETE — CREATIVE READY, TECHNICAL VALIDATION PENDING | PARTIAL — DATA DEPENDENCIES
REMAIN | PARTIAL — DESIGN OR PROOFREADING DEPENDENCIES REMAIN | BLOCKED — CRITICAL INPUTS MISSING).

## 24a. Agentic execution, revenue, cohort, ad, navigation & error module (OVERRIDES conflicts)
- **One execution surface:** the only primary control that STARTS automated generation is **Run Agentic Flow** (`?action=agentic-run`, 8 stages: data -> analysis -> planning -> calendar -> content -> assets -> review -> ideation). No competing "Generate Automated Calendar / Build Calendar / Five-Situation Generator / separate agent-run" execution controls. Other views inspect/edit/approve/filter/validate results; a per-slot/bulk **build** action (assets for already-planned rows) is allowed but is not a second *planning* engine. Consolidating the current "Generate all" into the Run-Agentic surface is the target.
- **Five-Situation library is subordinate:** Demand Capture / Product Education / Cross-Sell & Repeat / Winback & Re-engagement / Seasonal-Cultural-Brand-Moment are strategy archetypes, classification, guardrails, fallbacks, test structures and audit labels — NOT a parallel calendar generator. The agentic engine selects/adapts/rejects them from real data (eligibility, product relevance, exposure, inventory, claims, seasonality, objective, revenue need, novelty, region). Never blindly emit one campaign per situation per day.
- **Revenue feasibility (real math, no assumption-fudging):** default target $1,500/day attributed email revenue; at $42-43 AOV that is ~35-36 orders; at 3% click-to-purchase and 1-2% unique-click-of-delivered that is ~1,200 clicks and **~60,000-120,000 delivered emails/day**. A ~90-recipient send yields ~$1-2 and MUST be flagged. Per-date status one of: TARGET FEASIBLE [/HIGH/LOW CONFIDENCE] · REQUIRES MORE ELIGIBLE REACH · REQUIRES HIGHER CONVERSION · REQUIRES HIGHER AOV · REQUIRES MULTIPLE COHORTS · NOT FEASIBLE WITH CURRENT INPUTS. Distinguish target vs forecast vs actual vs confidence vs assumption source.
- **Multi-cohort day view:** up to 3 mutually exclusive send slots/day, each with its own campaign/objective/product/cohort/eligible/sends/forecast/frequency/creative/time; group all slots under the date; date-level totals = sum of slots (never evaluate each mailer against the full $1,500). If combined < target: re-evaluate cohort size/product/offer/situation/history, add another eligible exclusive cohort, raise AOV via approved bundle, delay low-value sends, or report the gap — never break the frequency cap to hit revenue.
- **Ads are cohesive compositions, not image+text:** mandatory hierarchy (pattern-interrupt/visual -> product recognition -> core message -> approved benefit -> offer -> CTA -> brand -> visual path); concept-first workflow before rendering; per-format layouts (1:1/4:5/9:16/16:9/Meta/Stories/TikTok/Pinterest/LinkedIn), not crops; quality gate >= 9.5/10; reject on "looks like separate image + text", wrong packaging, tiny product, unclear message/hierarchy, unreadable text, wrong region, unverified claim/price, black background, generic-template look.
- **Multimodal assets:** the engine chooses the best format (image / video / GIF / table / flowchart / lifecycle+funnel+cohort diagram / infographic / carousel / storyboard) per content; each with strategic purpose, source map, brand+contrast+proofread+packaging-fidelity+format validation, quality score.
- **Error diagnostics (no unexplained generic error):** every error surfaces human message, failed operation+step, campaign/asset id, region, product, connector/dependency, retry-safe flag, recovery action, timestamp, internal code, expandable technical details (no secrets/PII). Categories: SOURCE_DATA_MISSING · REGIONAL_PRODUCT_MISMATCH · CONNECTOR_UNAVAILABLE · AUTHENTICATION_FAILED · RATE_LIMITED · INVALID_CONFIGURATION · REVENUE_TARGET_INFEASIBLE · FREQUENCY_CAP_BLOCKED · ASSET_GENERATION_FAILED · PACKAGING_FIDELITY_FAILED · AD_QUALITY_FAILED · EMAIL_RENDER_FAILED · BUILD_FAILED · DATABASE_FAILED · UNKNOWN_ERROR.
- **Naming/nav:** nav item is **VAHDAM Brain** (not "Automated Calendar Creation"); primary CTA **Run Agentic Flow**; assistant is **SteepSense** (not ChaiGPT) everywhere; the raw `/uk-non-engagers` URL is not a user-facing nav item (route may stay reachable).

## 25. Final execution directive
Proceed autonomously when repo + tools + data suffice; make safe reasonable decisions from the repo
without asking. Never: silently omit hard requirements, simulate tool calls, fabricate data, expose
PII, force audience volume, create unsupported email interactions, invent URLs/ratings/reviews/claims/
prices/images/results, use the wrong regional source, recreate/alter packaging, mark untested work
verified, use black/ink section backgrounds, dark-on-dark or light-on-light text, misaligned/unequal
cards, unproofread copy, unsourced facts, visually broken layouts, or source-conflicted campaigns
marked launch-ready. Complete all unaffected work when a dependency is missing; mark blocked areas
precisely. Build the strongest complete implementation using only verified repo data/assets, exact
official regional sources, approved brand tokens, real available tools, verified+proofread content,
validated+readable UI, and exact real product packaging/branding.
