/**
 * order-attribution.js — which day did email actually drive the most orders?
 *
 * Reads every order in the window straight from the Shopify Admin API, classifies
 * each one by its OWN recorded source (landing_site UTMs, referring_site
 * fallback), buckets by the shop's local date, and reports the peak email day.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SECOND OPINION
 * Klaviyo reporting on Klaviyo's own performance cannot validate Klaviyo. This
 * path never touches the email platform: it counts orders that Shopify itself
 * recorded as arriving from an email click. If the two agree, the attribution is
 * trustworthy. If they disagree, the gap is the finding.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=vahdam.myshopify.com \
 *   SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN=shpat_xxx \
 *   LIVE_CONNECTORS=on \
 *   node scripts/order-attribution.js --market US --days 90
 *
 * Or against the deployed app (operator-only: that route reads orders with
 * their customer objects, so it needs a CRON_SECRET or an operator session):
 *   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
 *     "https://<app>/api/shopify?op=attribution&market=US&days=90"
