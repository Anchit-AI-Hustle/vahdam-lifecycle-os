# Creative brief

Write the designer-ready brief for: `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Sections (all mandatory — a designer should need NOTHING else)
1. Objective + single success metric.
2. Audience + the one feeling to evoke (this brand sells happiness/calm, not ingredients).
3. Key message (one sentence) + support points (each with its verified source: catalog, site, approved reviews only).
4. Mandatories: 4-color palette, Lao MN/Proxima Nova, logo rules, packaging must be the REAL SKU (no AI-invented tins), no banned phrases.
5. Format specs: sizes (1080x1080, 1080x1920, 1200x628 as relevant), platform safe-areas, max text coverage.
6. Motion spec (for video/Reels): hook in first 0.8s, shot list with camera moves, kinetic-type moments, CTA card — use the motion standard in scripts/lib/motion-ad.js (motionBrief) as the template.
7. References: 2-3 described directions (not links to rip), each with what to take from it.
8. Deliverables + naming: vahdam_{product}_{platform}_{format}_{WxH}.{ext}.

## Output
The 8-section brief, tight enough to hand off unedited. Offer next steps: /ad-creative (generation) or /design (Canva/Figma).

## Brand guardrails (always)
- Palette #004A2B / #AB8743 / #171717 / #FBF5EA; Lao MN headlines + Proxima Nova body.
- BANNED: wellness journey, transform, liquid gold, game-changer, LIMITED TIME (caps), hurry, don't miss out, last chance, while supplies last. No em/en dashes in output copy.
- Zero fabrication: never invent numbers, benchmarks, reviews, prices or URLs. Missing input -> ask for it or mark [DATA REQUIRED].
- Mega-prompt discipline: be clear, concise and highly specific; every claim quotes the exact figure or line it came from.
