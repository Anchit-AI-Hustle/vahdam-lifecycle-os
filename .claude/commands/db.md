# Database — Supabase (Postgres)

Handle: `$ARGUMENTS` using the **`supabase`** skill (and `supabase-postgres-best-practices` for tuning).

## Map
- Migrations: `supabase/migrations/` (timestamped). Apply-all bundle: `supabase/COMBINED_RUN_THIS.sql`. Seeds: `supabase/seed/`.
- Key tables: `smart_calendar_entries` (rolling 15-day plan), `ads_generated`, `landing_pages_generated`, KB tables, captured competitor emails, RFM/cohort data.
- Front-end gets URL + anon key from `/api/public-config`. **Service-role keys are NEVER exposed there** — keep it that way.

## Rules
- **Schema changes go through a new timestamped migration** in `supabase/migrations/` — never ad-hoc edits. Mirror into `COMBINED_RUN_THIS.sql` if that's the apply path.
- Reads/exploration are fine to run directly; **confirm before destructive DDL/DML.**
- Follow `supabase-postgres-best-practices` for indexing/RLS/query shape.

## Output
For queries: the SQL + results. For design: the migration file + rationale + rollback note. For architecture: an ER-level explanation grounded in the existing tables.
