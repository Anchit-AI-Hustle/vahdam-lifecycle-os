description: Build and deploy the Vahdam Lifecycle OS to Vercel.
argument-hint: "[optional: 'prod' to deploy to production]"

# Ship

Deploy the project. Args: `$ARGUMENTS` (`prod`/`production` → production; otherwise preview).

## Pre-flight (this repo's hard constraints)
- **Function count:** Hobby plan caps Serverless Functions at **12** and the app sits at the limit. If a new `api/*.js` was added, deploy will break — extend a `?action=` router or move logic into `api/_shared/` instead. Check `vercel.json` `functions`.
- `npm run build` runs at deploy (`scripts/build-catalog.js` → catalog JSON). Run it locally first to catch errors.
- New page? Add its rewrite to `vercel.json` `rewrites`.
- Never cache `/api/*` in `sw.js`.

## Method
Use the **`vercel-plugin:deploy`** skill. For env work use `vercel-plugin:env`. Confirm before a production deploy — it's outward-facing.

Report the deployment URL and any build warnings.
