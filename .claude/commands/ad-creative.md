# Ad creative generation

Create paid-social creatives for: `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Engine
Use the Higgsfield skills via the `higgsfield-*` toolchain:
- **Product/lifestyle stills, ad packs** → `higgsfield-product-photoshoot` (modes: `ad_creative_pack`, `lifestyle_scene`, `closeup_product_with_person`, `hero_banner`, `social_carousel`).
- **Video / Reels / UGC / animated** → `higgsfield-generate` (Seedance video, Marketing Studio for ads, image-to-video for animating a still).
- **GIF preview** → derive from the video.
- **Face/identity consistency** across a campaign → chain `higgsfield-soul-id`.
- When unsure which model, call `models_explore(action:'recommend')` first.

## Formats to deliver (match what was just shipped)
- Meta static `1080x1080` PNG
- Reels/Stories `1080x1920` MP4
- Reels preview `540x960` GIF

## Hard constraints
- **Bake the approved happiness-first copy directly into the creative** (P01 mandate; enforced in `api/_shared/master-prompt.js` + `api/ai/image.js`). Do not rely on platform text overlays.
- Only the 4 brand colors; Lao MN / Proxima Nova type feel.
- **No banned phrases.** Lead with the feeling (calm, warmth, ritual), not the ingredient spec.
- Save outputs to the repo root with descriptive names: `vahdam_{product}_{platform}_{format}_{WxH}.{ext}`.

## Reels-grade quality bar (the "as good as real Reels" standard)
The bar is what top reels actually do — not a slideshow of stills:
1. **Stills built to animate**: generate hero frames via Higgsfield product-photoshoot or `/api/ai/image` with `mode:'reels'` (cinematic 9:16, depth-separated layers for parallax, negative space for type, NO baked text).
2. **Real motion**: animate each frame with `higgsfield-generate` image-to-video (subtle push/pan/drift + organic motion only — steam, light; never added objects). Hook must move within 0.8s.
3. **Kinetic type**: headlines animate in word-staggered, not all at once; hard cut only into the CTA card.
4. **Instant preview / no-API fallback**: `scripts/lib/motion-ad.js` — `renderMotionAd(spec)` outputs a self-contained animated 9:16 HTML creative (layered Ken Burns, parallax veils, crossfades, kinetic type, CTA card), and `motionBrief(spec)` emits the same design as a shot-by-shot brief for Higgsfield/CapCut so the shipped MP4 matches the preview.
5. **Non-negotiables**: real SKU packaging only (never AI-invented tins), one filmic grade, licensed audio only, total under 15s, safe-areas (7% sides, bottom 18% clear).

Offer to mirror the assets into `ads_generated` and wire them to a campaign via `/campaign-plan`.
