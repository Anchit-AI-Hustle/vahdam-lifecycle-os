/**
 * Lifecycle cohort + play library for the UK retention program.
 *
 * Two engagement-based cohorts (NOT RFM segments — these are Klaviyo-style
 * engagement cohorts) and a library of email "plays" the on-demand lifecycle
 * calendar rotates through. Consumed by:
 *   api/_shared/lifecycle-calendar-generate.js  (planner)
 *   api/_shared/lifecycle-mailer-build.js       (brief builder)
 *
 * HARD BUSINESS RULE — NO FOUNDER VOICE anywhere in this program:
 * no founder letters, no "from our founder", no personal-name sign-offs.
 * The brand speaks as "we". Therefore every play's template_style is
 * restricted to 'pure' | 'visual' | 'editorial' (the calendar-trigger
 * renderer's non-founder branches). The 'founder' branch must NEVER be
 * selected — validated at module load below.
 *
 * Facts source of truth: data/product-types.json (locked from
 * lifecycle-campaigns/2026-07-03_week1/facts.md).
