/**
 * Copy + business framework library.
 *
 * Grounds every VAHDAM generator in a named, proven structure instead of a
 * blank page. This operationalizes the retention knowledge base - Chase
 * Dimond's #1 rule (knowledge/retention/01-chase-dimond.md): "Build the
 * framework library first. Every future brief starts by picking a framework
 * (PAS, AIDA, BAB, 4Ps, FAB, star-story-solution)."
 *
 * Two layers:
 *   1. COPY_FRAMEWORKS - how a single email is STRUCTURED (the beats).
 *   2. STRATEGY_FRAMEWORKS - the business logic behind WHAT to send and how
 *      hard to push (hammer-vs-nurture, RFM whale/minnow, discount ladder,
 *      three multipliers, brand-first performance, merchandising-is-retention).
 *
 * Callers pick a framework deterministically (same inputs → same choice, so
 * plans are reproducible) and inject its brief block into the LLM prompt. The
 * chosen framework key is carried on the output so previews can show it.
 *
 * Pure data + pure functions. No I/O, no provider calls. Safe to require from
 * any _shared module.
