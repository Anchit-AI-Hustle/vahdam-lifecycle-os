/**
 * daily-calendar-core — the day-level view of the whole operating loop.
 *
 * One row per DAY across past, today and future, each carrying what was planned,
 * which assets actually exist for it, and what was measured. It exists because
 * the loop it reports on had been dead for three weeks and every surface in the
 * app still looked healthy: the plan sync returned ok:true while the database
 * rejected every write, the daily job logged 'success' with seven skipped
 * connectors, and the rolling 90-day window quietly decayed to 58 days.
 *
 * Three rules hold this together.
 *
 * 1. FRESHNESS IS DERIVED, NEVER ASSERTED. Every "is this current?" answer is
 *    computed here from a timestamp compared against today, at read time. No
 *    stored `is_fresh` / `ran_today` flag is ever re-read as a live claim — that
 *    is exactly how ads-snowflake-core came to print "includes the current
 *    partial day" a week after the day in question.
 *
 * 2. AN ASSET COUNTS ONLY IF ITS ARTEFACT EXISTS. A slot is not "built" because
 *    it is approved, or because a marker says so; it is built when a campaign row
 *    is present and that row carries the channel's artefact. A green tick for a
 *    mailer nobody generated is worse than an empty cell.
 *
 * 3. MEASURED AND PLANNED NEVER MERGE. A future day has no measurements and says
 *    so with null, not 0. A past day with no reporting source says which source
 *    is dark. Only stored orders — real rows, already in the warehouse — produce
 *    a revenue figure.
